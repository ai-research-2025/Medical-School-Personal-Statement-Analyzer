“Am I still alive?”, she whispered anxiously from beneath the mountain of blankets. The question startled me. It was near the end of my evening shift in the quiet hallways of the anesthesia care unit, yet her raspy words pierced through the intermittent sound of monitors, grabbing my attention. I had grown accustomed to tending to pain by providing ice packs and adjusting wound dressings, but this was different. Faced with the weight of her fear, I felt an initial uncertainty: how should I comfort someone who believes they had confronted death?
By embracing this uncertainty, I found purpose not just in alleviating her physical discomfort, but also in offering reassurance and compassion. As a certified nursing assistant, I learned that care extends beyond tasks. More importantly, it requires a shared vulnerability between both the patient and provider, where the act of simply being present can be profoundly impactful. That evening, I witnessed the essence of medicine: a convergence of clinical expertise and empathy. It is this intersection—where science meets humanity—that inspires my ambition to become a physician. Moreover, through moments like these, I have realized that accompaniment is equally important as intervention in the process of healing, and I am committed to embracing both aspects of medicine.

From a young age, science has intrigued me for two reasons: it broadens my perspective of the world and life itself, and it provides the opportunity to pursue a career where I can tangibly impact others. However, the realization that my future career would involve science was prompted by a more progressive series of experiences. My early curiosity spurred interests in a variety of topics from the construction of skyscrapers to the history of ancient civilizations, but there was something deeply captivating about investigating living organisms. This fascination has continued through my immersion in biochemistry and neuroscience research where I have explored mechanisms that govern life. Whether analyzing enzymatic alterations of gene expression, or the proliferation of HIV in the brain, I have been drawn to the juxtaposition of both simplicity and complexity that defines science. It is this dynamic relationship that inspires my aspirations to improve knowledge of the human body, ultimately driving me to combine research and clinical practice as a physician.

Despite my interest in medicine, my answer to the question “what do you want to be when you grow up?” prompted significant introspection: “Doctor?”. As a child, however, I did not yet understand the significance of medicine—all I knew was that the white coat embodied a sense of trust rooted in scientific expertise. It wasn’t until I embarked on my college journey that I encountered opportunities that would reveal the true purpose and impact of medicine.

One such opportunity came after my first year of college when I embarked on a transformative journey to the Dominican Republic through Creighton’s Summer Health Program. As I descended the gravel roads with two large plastic jugs of filtered water swaying in my grasp, my gaze wandered from one mountain peak to another in the distance before finally settling on the outline of the rural community’s temporary medical clinic that gradually became clearer in view. Arriving at the clinic—where I served as an “ayudante” (helper)—my attention was drawn to the familiar face of an older lady named “Maria”. Although patient visits for the day had ended, I wasn’t surprised to see her sitting in the same chair where I had taken her vitals earlier that morning. “Buen día” (good day), I said to her, returning her warm greeting. Like others in the campo, Maria experienced severe poverty and suffered a variety of health complications due to a lack of resources and proper nutrition. Despite presenting with minor illnesses, she returned to the clinic almost every day—simply to talk to us. As I sat next to her, she began asking me about my day and eventually, my life in general. I ended up speaking with her in Spanish for almost an hour, listening to her experiences about living in a rural campo. As the sun set, Maria expressed her gratitude and embraced me and the team of medical students with hugs before leaving.

In that moment, I learned the profound impact of simply being present and offering companionship in patient care. Maria’s visits to the clinic, like many others in the campo, were not only about medical treatment; they were about human connection and the comfort of being cared for by others. Such exchanges with individuals like Maria have left an indelible mark on my memory, propelling my pursuit of a career in medicine.

Although medicine is rooted in science, it is ultimately a vocation devoted to treating individuals, not just illnesses. Moreover, discernment of my interactions with patients has prompted a definitive realization: I now unquestionably aspire to be a physician who not only applies science to heal, but also stands alongside patients through each step of their treatment journey. Medical school will equip me with the clinical expertise needed to harmonize the precision of science with the compassionate care that is essential for healing—two vital elements of restoring both hope and health.
