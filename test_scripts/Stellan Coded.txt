I used to think of service as simply an act of kindness, a way to give back. But at Creighton University, I came to understand service as a calling, one deeply rooted in dignity, justice, mindfulness, and unwavering compassion. The development of my faith strengthened my resolve to serve those often neglected by society: the marginalized, the poor, and the vulnerable. This commitment led me beyond the classroom and into the community, where I found purpose through the Schlegel Center for Service and Justice and, eventually, in the clinical setting at Lasting Hope Recovery Center. It was there, among individuals battling mental illness and substance abuse, that I realized my path: medicine, not just as a profession, but as a lifelong commitment to learning, serving others, and making healthcare accessible to all.

My first encounter with the Schlegel Center for Service and Justice, an organization rooted in the pillars of service, justice, solidarity, sustainability, community, simplicity, and reflection, was during a service trip to Cleveland, where I learned about the realities individuals experiencing homelessness face. The most transformative part of the trip was inviting community members into our center, where we shared meals and provided essentials like clothing and showers. As we lived alongside one another, our differences faded, and a deep sense of community began to form. Over seven days, familiar faces returned, allowing us to build meaningful relationships. One person in particular, James, shared his story with me during a quiet moment of conversation. At just 21 years old, he had fractured his foot from wearing shoes that were too small, the only pair he owned. Though he initially received medical care, he never returned for follow-up treatment because he lacked a phone, transportation, and the means to pay. His story made me reflect on the countless others facing similar challenges, not only with physical health, but also mental illness and substance use.

My conversations with James left me questioning how individuals experiencing homelessness or poverty can access the care they need. Social determinants of health have a profound impact on long-term outcomes, and after witnessing this up close, I began to ask myself: how can our healthcare system better address these disparities, and, just as importantly, what can I do?

Motivated by my time in Cleveland, I continued serving individuals experiencing homelessness in Omaha, which led me to Lasting Hope Recovery Center, a behavioral health hospital that supports those with mental illness and substance use disorders. As a mental health technician, I worked closely with individuals who were unhoused, battling addiction, or both. While it is rewarding to see patients overcome withdrawal, regain mental stability, and leave with a recovery plan, it is equally difficult to witness others return despite their initial progress. These successes and setbacks strengthened my commitment to patient care. In particular, I found purpose in my direct interactions with patients.

I have learned that effective communication involves more than just words; it requires reading body language, being mindful of patientsâ€™ cultural and religious backgrounds, and approaching every interaction with empathy for past trauma. Patients are not just their medical illnesses; they are people who need the expertise of medical professionals to help them overcome the challenges they face.

In parallel with my clinical experiences, I had the opportunity to shadow an internal medicine hospitalist who displayed an incredible breadth of scientific knowledge. Observing aspects of my coursework in practice was fascinating and fueled my desire to expand upon my own knowledge base to one day treat patients with the same level of precision and accuracy. However, through my service work and clinical experience, I saw firsthand how many patients relied on charity care, support that allowed them to focus on their recovery without the added burden of medical debt. This compelled me to pursue an accounting major alongside my pre-med studies, with the long-term goal of establishing a nonprofit to help manage financial resources for charitable healthcare.

My business coursework has given me a new lens through which to view healthcare, revealing how financial barriers often limit access. I hope to break down those barriers and help ensure that high-quality medical care is available to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.

My journey, from pre-med coursework to service involvement to direct patient interaction, has shaped my understanding of medicine as both a science and a vehicle for social justice. I have witnessed firsthand how financial barriers, mental health challenges, and systemic inequities prevent individuals from accessing the care they deserve. These experiences have deepened my commitment to become a physician who not only delivers compassionate, high-quality medical care but also works to dismantle the financial and social obstacles that limit access. As I take the next step toward medical school, I carry with me the values of service, justice, compassion, and human dignity, determined to make a lasting impact in the lives of those who need it most.
