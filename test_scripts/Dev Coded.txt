I eagerly knocked on Sam’s door with a soccer ball tucked under my arm and rain beading on my jacket. It was the kind of drizzle that turned the cul-de-sac into the perfect pitch to play for hours. Sam opened the door, shook his head, and tapped the back of his ear. Then he gently closed the door. His cochlear implant wasn’t built for the rain. His intricate device opened a door that most of us walked through without notice, but that door didn’t always stay open. At times, the batteries ran out or the background noise was too loud for the device to handle. Growing up with Sam showed me the transformative impact this device had: it gave him access to sound, but it didn’t make everything easy. I saw him struggle to listen to teachers in noisy classrooms, feel left out in conversations, and brace himself for the “What’s that thing on your ear?” question. I became his sidekick in helping to fill in the gaps and reviewing things he had missed in conversations. I didn’t realize it at the time, but witnessing remarkable medical advancements and understanding their reliance on human connection laid the groundwork that sent me down the path toward becoming a physician.

That path was clarified in eleventh grade when I visited my father’s village in southern India. A few villagers had gathered in the town’s coconut field, where my father, a physician, was offering informal checkups. There was no clinic in sight, only a few plastic chairs in the shade of the coconut trees that swayed overhead. “Salma,” a mother, stepped forward and explained that her eight-year-old son had been coughing all night. She stood protectively behind him with her hands wrapped around his shoulders. My father asked me to hand him the small metal tin that contained lozenges, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. He crouched down to the boy’s level, meeting his eyes with a warm smile. He took the boy’s temperature and listened to his breathing as he spoke in a calm voice, walking through the steps of his examination to Salma and her son. Turning to the mother, he softly said, “It’s a mild cold. Rest, hydration, and these lozenges will help.” Salma’s posture softened, and her hands eased from her son’s shoulders as if the weight of uncertainty was lifted from her. Salma’s posture softened, and her hands eased from her son’s shoulders as if the weight of uncertainty was lifted from her.

As I sat nearby clutching the tin, I watched how care could unfold with a few tools and a steady presence. I remembered my time with Sam and how I felt filling in the gaps as his sidekick, but I no longer wanted to witness moments like these. I wanted to be the one creating them as a physician.

Wanting to gain experience with direct patient care, I sought out an opportunity to step into the medical world as a CNA. I vividly remember one patient in the progressive care unit, “Fatima,” an elderly Pakistani woman who only spoke Urdu. As an Urdu speaker, I was one of the few people on the floor who could conversate with her. I introduced myself in Urdu, and her eyes widened with recognition. She told me about her home in Pakistan, where the streets were quiet and the mornings were filled with the calls of peacocks. She explained how the beeping of the machines around her made it hard to rest. Through my broken Urdu, Fatima shared her love for classical Urdu music. The next day, I brought my mom’s CD player with Urdu songs. As the music filled the room, I saw Fatima’s demeanor change as comfort washed over her. I was able to provide her with a hint of solace by offering this music.

Fatima solidified my desire to work in communities where individuals are seen for their diverse histories.

Around the time I began working as a CNA, I also started volunteering at a homeless shelter. Often while volunteering, I would spend hours filling water bottles with ice and water for the patrons waiting in line. It seemed like a small task, but it became a way to connect. One regular visitor was a Burmese refugee named “Alex” who often stayed to talk. He spoke about his journey through a refugee camp and the challenges of starting over in a place where he knew no one. One day, after he finished speaking, he said, “It’s nice to talk sometimes.” That line continues to resonate with me. I thought of how many people carry stories but rarely have someone to listen to them.

Alex made me more aware of how easy it is to overlook someone’s struggle when all you see is a person in a line for water and ice. His story reminded me that many people live on the margins and face struggles that go unseen. As a physician, I will remember that sometimes “it’s nice to talk.”

Sam, Salma, Fatima, and Alex all needed their needs met, and those needs included the often-overlooked intangibles. Years ago, Sam showed me how medical devices can change lives, but also how easily some can be left out when systems don’t account for the human factor. Fatima and Alex showed me the importance of cultural sensitivity and how small acts can offer comfort. Salma’s story revealed how reassurance and clear communication can ease fear in moments of uncertainty. What linked these experiences wasn’t the setting or the tools. It came down to the presence of someone who could respond with compassion and insight. These experiences have affirmed my desire to become a physician who serves as an advocate, educator, and trusted partner in care.
