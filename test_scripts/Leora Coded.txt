My CNA shift at the nursing home nears its conclusion. Full of unfamiliarity, I keep busy learning the resident’s routines on a new unit. Once I begin charting, the nurse approaches me and asks if I have ever changed an ileostomy bag, gesturing to the room behind me. I confidently nod. I introduce myself to the resident, explaining my presence. My fingers effortlessly dance through each step, uncertainty evaporating; we talk, and I tell her I, too, once had an ileostomy bag. 
I received my ulcerative colitis diagnosis at sixteen years old after months of disregarding alarming symptoms. As each infusion medication failed, my condition approached a critical point where more radical treatments remained my only viable option. I began deteriorating exponentially, losing nearly thirty pounds and rushing to the bathroom twenty times a day despite losing my appetite entirely. Three months after my diagnosis, my colorectal surgeon performed a total colectomy, removing my large intestine and replacing it with an ileostomy bag. Before entering college, I opted to brave a two-part ileoanal anastomosis surgery where my surgeon reconstructed my small intestine into a “j-pouch,” allowing for internal bowel movements. Since then, I have undergone three more surgeries to fix complications regarding my condition. 
My sudden exposure to medicinal teamwork and terminology initiated my internal desire to fulfill these “why me” questions arising daily. Following my diagnosis, I struggled to accept that my faulty body would physically encapsulate my personhood, incessantly reminding me of life’s finality. Through this pivotal moment, I, in every aspect of the word, changed. Modern medicine not only preserved my life, but it revealed my purpose: becoming a physician.

When I lost my colon, I gained two momentous insights. First, I developed an unwavering passion for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) advocacy. Second, by living with an invisible disease I discovered the fundamental importance of language, both in the medical field and life. Together, these perspectives weave into my underlying drive for pursuing medicine.

Growing up in a small town narrowed my exposure to others experiencing similar circumstances, and I felt isolated. Therefore, I almost immediately became involved with the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation. Inspired by their community, I formed a club on my college’s campus, Gut Feelings, devoted to fundraising, volunteering, and advocating for the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation. Through Gut Feelings, I connected with other college students enduring their own IBD journey. Invigorated by Gut Feelings’ local impact, I applied and was selected to serve as a member of the National Council of College Leaders for the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation (NCCL) where I work alongside other college students with IBD to create impact nation-wide. Both Gut Feelings and the NCCL introduced me to students who understand the hardships I endure daily. These organizations not only provided me the opportunity to advocate and fundraise for IBD—they transformed my ulcerative colitis into a commonality rather than an abnormality.

Without my ileostomy bag, any visible manifestations of my ulcerative colitis vanished, allowing me to outwardly appear healthy, which leads to harmful assumptions about my condition’s severity. Through my involvement in the previously mentioned activities as well as my English minor coursework, I learned the significance of language. I believe a doctor must not only know the definition of diseases—they must make the invisible, visible.

I strive to not only possess the knowledge to define symptoms and their associations, but I also hope to uncover the seemingly nonexistent. The first physician to believe my symptoms proceeded with a colonoscopy and discovered my ulcerative colitis; I firmly feel the best support a physician can give is belief, and I plan to continually provide my patients with an acknowledgment of their experience.

When I first changed an ileostomy bag from the perspective of a caregiver rather than a patient, I viewed my world from another angle, one I only dreamed of as I lay helplessly on my hospital bed, impatiently waiting for better days. Now, I reap the consequences of my ulcerative colitis, allowing its daunting obstacles to motivate me further to pursue opportunities and remain sincere. Each morning, during my overnight hospital stays, my healthcare team rounded—half inquiring about my present condition, half creating light-hearted banter. Their confidence regarding my upward recovery instilled in me a sense of safety amid my terrifyingly foreign circumstances. I believe to be a physician means to care for those who, like me, feel alone, different, and incomplete. Whether interacting with physicians while volunteering for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, shadowing a colonoscopy, or laying on the operating table, I am constantly inspired by their genuineness, and, as a physician, I hope to provide this same level of genuine care.
